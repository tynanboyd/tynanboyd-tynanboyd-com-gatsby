Last night, CBC's The National profiled Waskom, Texas, the so-called "sanctuary city for the unborn". I have little to add to the truly important part of the story here, although my opinion will inevitably reveal itself it my consolation letter for Chandler Van De Water. Or at least I thought I'd be writing a consolation letter, until I started digging in.

Waskom has marked its appreciation of Texas's abortion law with a new mural. Here stands Waskom Mayor Jesse Moore in front of it.

It's the mural I want to talk about here. I have seen colleagues, friends and folks on Reddit with an uncanny ability to recognize typefaces, but there are a couple dozen font families that my moderately trained eye can pick out of the crowd. One of those is Cubano, created by a designer from Greenville, South Carolina.

Here it is on [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/cubano).
